# Wimli
Wimli is a game I'm developing for the Games Programming module at the University of Dundee.

I have used the following tutorial: http://html5hub.com/how-to-make-a-sidescroller-game-with-html5/ and have forked the relevant repo. I will be adding comments throughout to show I understand the code. I will also be amending the existing code to fit my game and adding extra functionality.

Game summary:
A simple 2D side-scrolling platformer where you play as Wimli, a ginger dog whose girlfriend, Rosie, has been stolen. 

Your aim is to rescue Rosie from the evil dog-napper! In a range of levels, you will face enemies that will try and stop you. You can defeat enemies with your secret weapon, Pee Power. You will also collect power-ups which will help boost your score and defeat enemies.
